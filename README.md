# Famous Landmarks Around the World Word Guess Game

https://conniepope.github.io/Word-Guess-CLI/

This application was created using Javascript, Node.js, and JSON.

The game takes in user input to guess the mystery word. You get 10 incorrect letter guesses before the game is over. As soon as the game is over (win or lose), a new word is selected and a new game starts.
